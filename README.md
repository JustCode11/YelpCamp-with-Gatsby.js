  Gatsby's hello-world starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this hello-world boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new my-hello-world-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-hello-world-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üöÄ Quick start (Gatsby Cloud)

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

# YelpCamp Site created with Gatsby.js, MongoDB and Firebase

## Description

This website offers the exploration and rental of campsites. On the home page, you can search for campsite titles using the search bar. Users can register and log in. The campsites on the home page can be selected to open a detailed view with comments and a map from Google Maps. The entire web application is responsive.

### Motivation

I developed this web application to familiarise myself with the static site generator [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I used Codewell's [YelpCamp](https://www.codewell.cc/challenges/yelpcamp-by-colt-steele--6144c7c8a383e41090a3d84b) as a template for the user interface. Furthermore, I also wanted to use some Gatsby plugins, including:
- gatsby-plugin-image, to insert responsive images that do not affect the performance of the website too much.
- gatsby-source-mongodb, to include a MongoDB database
- gatsby-plugin-local-search, to include a search engine

### Features

With the help of the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) development platform and the Firebase Authentication service, a user administration was created in the Gatsby.js web application.
Marcos Lombog's [blog entry](https://betterprogramming.pub/build-a-gatsby-authentication-flow-with-firebase-72b9514f6c9b) helped me to set this up.
The campsites and comments are stored in a MongoDB database. Gatsby.js uses GraphQL to access the data. The images in the database are in base64 format. For the conversion I used this website: [base64-image](https://www.base64-image.de/).
For the search of the campsites on the homepage I used the library [flexsearch.js](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch). The [blog entry](https://www.emgoto.com/gatsby-search/) by emma grotto helped me a lot with the implementation.
For the styling of the website I only used [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) with the BEM naming convention.

### Still to do

- implement firebase with the gatsby.js plugin gatsby-plugin-firebase
- replace the comments with a plugin such as [disqus](https://disqus.com/)
- use a content management system like [contenful](https://www.contentful.com/) for the data
